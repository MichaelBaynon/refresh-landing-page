        <h1>The Gamified Habit Change App Every Lambda Student Needs</h1>
          <p>
            Lambda School is insanely hard by design (trust us, we know!). 
            But that doesn't mean you must sacrifice your health and fitness to become a web developer. 
            With our help, you'll prevent burnout and boost every aspect of wellness... while exceling in your studies.

            <p> We took a poll of 50+ Lambda School students. <br><br>50% feel as if they don't have time for anything 
                that doesn't involve web development. <br><br>While code <em>is</em> life, it shouldn't consume your <strong>entire</strong> life.

              We know all about the biggest stressors that plague most Lambdanites. <br><br>Lectures that go over, forcing you to skip
              lunch for fear of getting behind later. <br><br>The terror that takes over when you go blank during a Sprint Challenge.
              <br><br>That frustrating moment when you shut down, thinking you're done for the day, <br> before remembering you forgot to
              fill out your thousandth retrospective of the week.

              There are a million apps on the market that promise to help you develop healthy habits. Most are useless.<br><br>
              Why? They're not designed with your specific needs and pain points in mind. <br><br>These habit apps are too focused on gaining 
              the largest possible userbase. <br><br>In the process, they create an app that's too arbitrary to be effective for most people.
              <br><br>Refresh is different. Our app is custom made for you, the average Lambda student.
