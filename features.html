        <h1>5 Features Every Lambda School Student Needs to Know</h1>
        <div class="feature one">
            <h2>1. Custom Missions</h2>
                <p>
                    Upon account completion, you'll receive the power to choose your own adventure. More specifically: you will be
                    guided through a short survey -- no text inputs required! -- that will help you isolate the missions or quests
                    that will have the greatest impact in your life. Along the way, you'll encounter dungeons and boss battles you
                    must conquer to "level up" your potential.
                </p>
            <h2>2. Built In Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    You're not alone in the fight to improve your health and fitness. No man or woman is an island, so Refresh 
                    borrows some tricks from social media apps. Daily, you'll be exposed to a feed full of Lambda School students who are 
                    making strides in their quest to build healthy habits. You can also join a team of peers led by your TL, SL, or 
                    an instructor who will encourage you to refresh your system on a daily basis.
                </p>
            <h2>3. Points Based Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    This app is intentionally designed to feel like a video game. You'll earn points every time you check off a 
                    healthy habit. Stack two or three related habits together to double or triple your total score. If you land 
                    on top of the Refresh Leaderboard, you could win an Amazon giftcard or some sweet Lambda swag. We also provide
                    cool reports in the form of charts and graphs that vividly illustrate how much you've acheived.
                </p>
            <h2>4. Social Media Integration</h2>
                <p>
                    No need to tell us your email address. Simply integrate your account with Facebook, Twitter, or GitHub. 
                    You'll receive instant access to a dashboard where you can customize your path to a healthier, happier life.
                    And unlike all the other stuff you downloaded for Lambda School, we won't constantly clog up your inbox with spam.

                </p>
            <h2>5. Cool Animated Celebrations</h2>
                <p>
                    Every step you take towards a healthy lifestyle should be celebrated. As you complete quests and missions,
                    we'll celebrate with a colorful animation that's guaranteed to make you smile. Team-based achievements
                    get the best animations, because we want to emphasize the effectiveness of a community-based approach.
