            <h1>5 Features Every Lambda Student Needs to Know</h1>
            <p>Refresh is built with you, the average Lambda School student, in mind. Below are the top five benefits of downloading our healthy habit app.
        </div>
        <h2>1. Custom Missions</h2>
        <div class="copy">

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Upon account completion, you'll receive the power to choose your own adventure. <br><br>More specifically: you'll be
                    guided through a short survey -- no text inputs required! -- to help you pick a quest that's a good fit for you. 
                    <br><br>Along the way, you'll encounter dungeons and boss battles you must conquer to "level up" your potential.
                </p>

                    You're not alone in the fight to improve your health and fitness. <br><br> No man or woman is an island, so Refresh 
                    borrows some tricks from social media apps. <br><br> Daily, you'll be exposed to a feed full of Lambda School students who are 
                    making strides in their journey to build healthy habits. <br><br> You can also join a team of peers led by your TL, SL, or 
                    an instructor who will encourage you to refresh your system every single day.

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    This app is intentionally designed to feel like a video game. <br><br> You'll earn points every time you check off a 
                    healthy habit. <br><br> Stack two or three related habits together to double or triple your total score. 
                    <br><br> If you land on top of the Refresh Leaderboard, you could win an Amazon giftcard or some sweet Lambda swag. 
                    <br><br>We also provide nifty reports in the form of charts and graphs that vividly illustrate how much you've accomplished.
